New York (NY or N.Y.) is a state located in the Northeastern United States. New York was one of the original Thirteen Colonies that formed the United States. With an estimated 20 million residents in 2019, it is the fourth most populous state. In order to distinguish the state from its city with the same name, it is sometimes referred to as New York State (NYS).

Two-thirds of the state's population lives in the New York metropolitan area (nearly 40% on Long Island). (Wikipedia)
